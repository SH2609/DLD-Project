# DLD-Project
This is the game that we made as our final project for DLD course using verilog. Basically our motivation was to create a game that can be used as a physiotherapic execise tool. In order for that we created the Chrome T-Rex game that read input from users hand movement using IR Sensor and translated it into the movement of TRex in game. The game was written in verilog.
